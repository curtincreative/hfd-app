Before we dive in, let’s talk a bit about the use cases of infrastructure-as-code frameworks like Terraform. Terraform provides ready-made infrastructure-as-code modules to build and scale cloud-hosted web applications with just a few lines of code. As that benefit has become more evident for teams deploying to complex multi-cloud environments, Terraform adoption has skyrocketed.

Terraform has set the standard for usability and extendibility for infrastructure-as-code. You can find Terraform deployment templates—called modules—on GitHub and the open-source [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/). By modifying just a few variables, you have ready-made networking, storage, or compute workloads ready for deployment.
